This is a document for notes so I don't have to keep looking stuff up

Vim Tips: 
    jump back and forth between your open files: (look up :h jumplist for more)
        Ctrl-i
        Ctrl-o
    
    ,t will open up Nerd Tree

    :e filename will open up another file

    :tabnew will create a new tab
        ,n and ,m to switch between them

    YouCompleteMe (vim plugin for code completion):
        I mapped ,g to go to definition or declaration (see .vimrc)
